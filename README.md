Varicad 3D design for Tesla's high frequency alternator.

This version carries a smaller machine with 120 poles. Tesla's original
design with 384 poles is too expensive to make. The idea is to couple
this version with Tesla's turbine, thus drive it at higher speed and in
this way make up for the fewer number of the poles. I hope to reach around
20 kHz with this machine.
